# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-
That's a powerful-looking dashboard! Based on the visuals and data points in the "HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD," I've put together a comprehensive project brief that outlines its goals, technology, and business value.

1. Project Title/Headline
"HR Attrition Risk and Retention Dashboard"

2. Short Description/Purpose
This project delivers a dynamic business intelligence (BI) dashboard focused on Employee Attrition Analysis. Its purpose is to provide HR leaders and management with a real-time, 360-degree view of employee turnover trends. By visualizing key metrics and breaking down attrition by critical dimensions (age, salary, tenure, and job role), the dashboard enables the rapid identification of high-risk groups and underlying factors driving voluntary turnover.

3. Tech Stack
List the key technologies used to build the dashboard.
Example:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
•Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation. 
•Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
•DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• Data Modeling - Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
•File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

 4. Data Source

* **Primary Source:** YouTube.
* **Key Data Elements:** Employee ID, Job Role, Department, Age, Gender, Education, Salary/Compensation, Date of Hire, Date of Separation/Exit, Reason for Exit (Voluntary/Involuntary).

5. Features / Highlights
•Business Problem
The business is experiencing an unacceptably high rate of employee turnover, leading to significant costs in recruitment, training, and lost productivity. The problem is that the organization lacks clear visibility into why and where attrition is occurring, making it difficult to implement effective retention strategies.
•Goal of the Dashboard
The primary goal of this dashboard is to diagnose the attrition problem by visualizing key HR metrics. It aims to identify the demographic, educational, and job-related groups most affected by turnover to enable data-driven decisions that will ultimately reduce the overall attrition rate.
•Walk-through of Key Visuals
  Key Metrics: The company has 1480 employees, with 238 departures, resulting in a high Attrition Rate of 16.1%. The average employee is 37 years old with an average salary of $6.5K and an average of 7.0 years at the company.
 Attrition by Education: The pie chart shows that most employees have a Bachelor's Degree (39%) or are in Life Sciences (37%), but the breakdown of attrition by education would be needed for a direct insight here.
  Attrition by Age: The bar chart suggests that the highest volume of attrition is in the 26-30 age group, followed by 31-35.
  Attrition by Years at Company: This line graph indicates that the majority of turnover happens early in an employee's tenure, specifically in the first few years (likely 0-5 years based on the spike).
 Attrition by Job Role: The largest number of leavers are in the Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles. The matrix shows a significant number of leavers are Male in these same roles.
•Business insights and impact 
1) High Attrition Rate (16.1%) - Impact: Significant financial burden and loss of institutional knowledge. Action: A company-wide initiative is needed to set a target attrition rate (e.g., 10%) and measure the success of retention efforts against this goal. 
2)Early Tenure Turnover - Impact: Suggests flaws in the onboarding process, job fit, or initial compensation. Action: Investigate the first 1-3 years of employment; revamp the onboarding and mentoring programs to increase early engagement and support. 
3)Sales Executives & Research Scientists - Impact: The business is losing its front-line revenue drivers and key innovators. Action: Conduct targeted exit interviews for these specific roles to understand role-specific frustrations (e.g., workload, compensation, management) and implement specific retention strategies for these high-impact departments.
4)Younger Age Groups (26-35) - Impact: Loss of a key segment of the future workforce. Action: Review compensation and career development opportunities for employees in this age bracket, as they are often seeking faster progression.
